# ionic-nfc-example

### Why?
Just trying to make it work somehow for a simple app using Ionic Native NFC (against all odds).

## Installation
```bash
$ yarn install:clean
```

## Usage
- Connect your device and enable USB debugging.
- `yarn start`.
- Launch `chrome://inspect/#devices` to start the remote debugging.

## Troubleshooting
After went through highs and lows, centaurs, cyclops, hydras, and unicorns, I managed to make it work eventually.

Just keep going. You'll get there.
